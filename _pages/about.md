My name is Tyler Etters.

I operate out of Los Angeles.

In 2024 I'm primarily releasing music as [They Became What They Beheld](https://tbwtb.com), producing for [RGB](https://untitled.stream/library/project/RoTfZpW8dHvJVVpmd6kpf), and causing mayhem at [Circular Ruin DSP](https://circularruindsp.com).

Visit my [discography](/discography) for a lot more of my music.

I work as a Senior Full Stack Engineer at [Discogs](https://discogs.com). I hold a BFA in graphic design from [Columbia College Chicago](https://colum.edu).
